**Magnus Effect Simulation in OpenFOAM**

Forked from [openfoamtutorials/openfoam_tutorials](https://github.com/openfoamtutorials/openfoam_tutorials)

Description

Here we will simulate the Magnus effect on a spinning cylinder in freestream in a 2D simulation in OpenFOAM. The mesh will be hybrid structured-unstructured and generated in Gmsh. The flowfield will be inspected.

Outline

-Gmsh mesh overview.

-Mesh generation and conversion to OpenFOAM.

-Simulation using pimpleFoam.

-Inspect flow field.
